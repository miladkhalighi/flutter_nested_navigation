# Nested Navigation in Flutter

This project demonstrates the advanced navigation capabilities in Flutter, highlighting both nested navigators for independent navigation stacks and the implementation of custom route transitions for enhanced UX.

## Why Nested Navigators?

Nested navigators are used when parts of the app, like tabs in a BottomNavigationBar, need to have independent navigation states and histories. This allows users to navigate within one tab, switch to another, and then return to the original tab and resume where they left off.
